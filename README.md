African vs East Asian Classification using-TensorFlow

This project demonstrates an image classification model built using TensorFlow. The model is designed to classify people into two categories based on facial features:
- African people
- East Asian people




The model was trained using Teachable Machine with a diverse and balanced dataset to ensure reliable predictions.


-Features
- Classifies input images into African or East Asian categories.
- Provides confidence scores for each prediction.
- Processes images efficiently with TensorFlow.
